# Nemo plugins & scripts

Purpose:
add context menus to the **Nemo file browser** (Mint file browser).

I did it for myself, this repo exists just to share with those who might be interested.
Linux Users, Arch / Manjaro with Cinnamon (Though I use Nemo on XFCE)


###Quick doc:

- **archive**: it creates a tar of the selected files 
- **bcompare**: add **Beyond Compare** to the context menu of the Nemo file browser, comparing the selected files. I wrote it because the native plugin (binay) sometimes disappear ie after package updates - each time it is annoying
- **catfish** search in the selected folder
- **extract to subfolder**: extract an archive to a subfolder created with the name of the archive without the extension
- **image to pdf**: from a PNG/JPG image, creates a PDF file (asking for its name)
- **mate disk usage analyzer**: disk usage of the selected folder
- **mate search tool**: search in the selected folder
