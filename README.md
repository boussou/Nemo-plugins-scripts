# Nemo-plugins-scripts

Purpose:
add context menus to the **Nemo file browser** (Mint file browser)


###Quick doc:

- **archive**: it creates a tar of the selected files 
- **bcompare**: add **Beyond Compare** to the context menu of the Nemo file browser, comparing the selected files. I wrote it because the native plugin sometimes disappear ie after package updates - it is always annoying
- **catfish** search in the selected folder
- **extract to subfolder**: extract an archive to a subfolder created with the name of the archive without the extension
- **image to pdf**: from a PNG/JPG image, creates a PDF file (asking for its name)
- **mate disk usage analyzer**: disk usage of the selected folder
- **mate search tool**: search in the selected folder
